mpirun was unable to find the specified executable file, and therefore
did not launch the job.  This error was first reported for process
rank 24; it may have occurred for other processes as well.

NOTE: A common cause for this error is misspelling a mpirun command
      line parameter option (remember that mpirun interprets the first
      unrecognized command line token as the executable).
